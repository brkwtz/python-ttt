Several versions of a two-player command line game of tic-tac-toe.

Each version adds complexity and sophistication in code structure/concepts and/or functionality.

tic-tac-toe-simple.py is the original version, written without objects.

tic-tac-toe.py is the second version, refactored to use objects and optimized to minimize non-hidden methods (paired with Mike Burns)

tic-tac-toe-2.py is the third version, where the second player is replaced by an unsophisticated AI (paired with Oskar Thoren)

More coming soon!
